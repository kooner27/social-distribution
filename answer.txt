Question 2: What are some of the differences between TypeScript and JavaScript?
Static Typing:
JavaScript: It is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime.
TypeScript: It introduces static typing, allowing you to define types for variables, function parameters, and return types at compile-time
Interfaces and Enums:
JavaScript: Does not have built-in support for interfaces or enums.
TypeScript: Introduces interfaces for defining object shapes 

Question 3: Why is a web application bundler (Parcel, Webpack, Rollup, etc.) useful for modern web projects? What are some features that ParcelJS provides?
Managing dependencies manually can be complex and error-prone. Bundlers automate the process of handling dependencies, ensuring that the correct versions are included and that the order of loading is appropriate.
Parcel is designed to provide fast bundle times by utilizing parallel processing.
